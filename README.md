# VSOpenCPPCoverage

VSOpenCPPCoverage is a Visual Studio extension for OpenCPPCoverage. Currently it works with the 64-bit version of OpenCPPCoverage.

NOTE: This is a Visual Studio extension that only works when https://opencppcoverage.codeplex.com (64-bit) is installed. Tested with 
Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.

# Features

- Highlighting covered and uncovered code directly from Visual Studio.
- Report generation of covered code (Tools -> Coverage report).
- Run code coverage on VS unit tests (Right click VS project -> Run code coverage).

If you don't use MSTest, you can still use the Cobertura XML file generated by OpenCPPCoverage as "Coverage.xml" to the solution folder.
