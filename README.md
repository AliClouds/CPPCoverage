# VSOpenCPPCoverage

VSOpenCPPCoverage is a Visual Studio extension for OpenCPPCoverage. Currently it works with the 64-bit version of OpenCPPCoverage.

NOTE: This is a Visual Studio extension that only works when https://opencppcoverage.codeplex.com (64-bit) is installed. Tested with 
Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.

# Installation

Prerequisites: VS2013 or VS2015. Any edition should work, even though this is only tested on VS2015 Community.

- Install OpenCPPCoverage x64 and/or x86 from https://opencppcoverage.codeplex.com/ .
- Install this extension: https://github.com/atlaste/VSOpenCPPCoverage/raw/master/CoverageExt/CoverageExt.vsix .

# Getting started

Working with VSOpenCPPCoverage is a breeze. Basically install and use, there's nothing more to it:

- Either create a standard C++ / MS Test application, or run a simple C++ / console application. Note that OpenCppCoverage assumes that there is no user input during the test run.
- Right-click in solution explorer on the test or application project, click "Run code coverage".
- Open a file that you want to show coverage info for. If the file is already open, close it and open it again. 
- For an overview, go to Tools -> Coverage report

# Features

- If you don't use MSTest, you can still use the Cobertura XML file generated by OpenCPPCoverage as "CodeCoverage.xml" to the solution folder.
